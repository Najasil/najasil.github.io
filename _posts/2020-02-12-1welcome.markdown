Lovely to have you here! 

As a part-time English teacher, I'm constantly looking for ways to keep my lessons interesting and lively, both for me and my students. 
I'm always on the hunt for new games, activities and material to use with the kids. 
If you are working with children as well, chances are, you too are looking for fresh ideas to diversify your lessons. 


If my children's reaction is "What? Time is already up?" at the end of a lesson, I know, the lesson went well. The more fun you have, the easier you learn and the faster time flies.


In sharing my ideas with you, I hope to be an inspiration for you and to spark new ideas. 
I would love for you to do the same and share your amazing ideas with the world, so we can all learn from each other and with each other!

**Learning is fun, when you do it together.**

So grab a cup of coffee, get comfy and browse through the posts. I hope you'll find something you can use.
