This colourful memory can be used as a warm-up activity with advanced students or as a fun activity to aquire new vocabulary.
For younger ones it can also be played as a word-picture-match-up game. If you print it twice and colour code it, you could even play in teams and make it a competition.

I have printed the word cards twice and played it as a relay race with my students. I had them place their word cards on the opposite side of the room and each round one of each team races to the word cards to bring the correct one for the picture I laid down. This is a great way to get them up and moving!

Print it, cut it, laminate it to protect it from sticky children's fingers ;)

Have fun!
