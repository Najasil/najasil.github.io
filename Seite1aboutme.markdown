Hi! I'm Lisa, a twenty-something-year-old student of English and German language and literary studies, tutor and part-time English teacher.
If I'm not busy interpreting poems or looking for tropes and symbols in short stories, 
I can often be found creating teaching material and preparing lessons. 
I ***love*** everything that delivers what I want to teach in a fun way. 
If it is colourful, sparkly or interesting to touch, makes sound or screams pedagogically valuable in any other way, 
I ***have*** to have it.

If you're interested in finding out more about where I work, you can visit [Helen Doron English](https://www.helendoron.de/).

Besides teaching, I spend my time drinking coffee with friends and family, running or watching Netflix. 
I like taking the time to cook special meals with and for my loved ones and going for walks with my dog. 
I enjoy good books on rainy weekends and hiking on sunny ones. 
I will almost never say no to a cup of good tea and will eat all the vegetable sushi my stomach can fit.

I want to use this website to share some of the stuff I create for my lessons and to get into contact with like-minded people.
